                <h2>When you're here, You're family!</h2>
                <p>No matter how far you travel. Or even if you are rooting for the other side
                  (Booooo.. Just kidding!. Err Maybe.) You can always find a friendly tent that
                   will welcome you in, that is around the kingdom of the Chiefs Stadium!</p>
                <h2>Last Week's Standings</h2>
                <p>It was a roller coaster of emotions with both teams going toe-to-toe with each
                   other early in the game. However as the game led on, the Bills clearly had the
                    advantage in this one and eventually took over by half with no end in sight.
                    A great adversary came in and we have to take a look inward for the next
                    challenge!</p>
